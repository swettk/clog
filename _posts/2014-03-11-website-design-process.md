It is important to remember that:
##Website Design is Product Design, not Graphic Design <a name="product-design"></a>
Print designers are used to designing for a 2-dimensional medium. Superficially, the web resembles this medium, as we primarily perceive it through the 2d screen, but it very quickly becomes apparent that the web is more than 3-dimensional (check [this](http://tympanus.net/Development/AnimatedBooks/index.html) out, for example). In addition to the virtual 3d, there are also the various data layers and [hyperlinking](http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/) to take into account.

In addition, content on the web is much more fluid than its printed counterpart, and must be designed to fit on various types of screen. In print, we focus on pixel-perfect control, but with the wide variation in internet-accessible devices, and with the field only expanding, we have to relinquish this control and accept that it is ok if a webpage looks different when viewed across different platforms.

## The Web is (and should be) 95% Typography <a name="typography"></a>

Despite platform inconsistencies, leading, word &amp; letter spacing, active white-space and dosed uses of color are key issues.

### Think of Text as a User Interface <a name="text-as-ui"></a>



## Work with Light, not layers of Color <a name="work-with-light"></a>



## Make fonts larger! <a name="make-fonts-larger"></a>

#### "A printed work which cannot be read becaomes a product without purpose"

The default font size on a browser is 16 pt (pixels), for a good reason. Most of us have good eyesight, but there are plenty of people using the web that don't.

## Paper wants Grey Noise, the Screen Doesn't <a name="paper-wants-grey-noise"></a>

Every extra word risks losing the reader

The goal is to stay simple... but without over-simplifying or being sensational, which works only for the "dumb" audience.

## Start with the Business Objectives <a name="business-objectives"></a>
It's a good idea to start the design process by looking at what the product is hoping to achieve. Without clearly defining the objectives of the website, it is easy to fall into the trap of producing web sites, 'just so that they're there'.

## Calls to Action <a name="calls-to-action"></a>
What is it that we want users to do once they reach our site? And what's the best way to help them achieve that goal?
