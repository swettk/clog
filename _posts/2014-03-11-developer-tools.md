##The IDE (Integrated Development Environment) <a name="ide"></a>
This is essentially a text-editor, but modern IDEs incorporate a host of features to make our lives easeier as developers, including syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and build scripts. My IDE of choice (Sublime Text) also incorporates incredibly useful feature integration with FTP and Git.

##Git (or or version-control software) <a name="git"></a>
Git tracks changes to files within our projects. It also provides powerful and convenient options to roll-back changes, or to merge changes from two or more sources, as git is built for *distributed* development. 

##FTP (File transfer protocol) <a name="ftp"></a>
Used to upload files to the remote host.
