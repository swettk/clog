## Ruby on Rails, Python's Django, PHP's Zend or Laravel and others: Application Frameworks <a name="app-frameworks"></a>
Frameworks are built following common development practices. The developers have observed common activities and tasks that web developer's have been coding, over and over, and built a standard set of functions and methods to implement them. This allows more rapid development, as main core functions have been abstracted and standardised. There's no need to design and build standard procedures that have been used and re-uesd countless time over the last 20 years. These are already in place and available in short-hand methods.

Most frameworks are also highly *extensible*. Frameworks (especially) popular frameworks usually play well with other frameworks and libraries within their language, and incorporate many modules for all kinds of common- or not-so-common tasks. Chances are, if you are a humble developer, not breaking new ground, just trying to build useful applications, you will find that whatever you want to do has already been done. And most of the time, someone has made a plug-in or framework extension to make it easier. Ruby, Python, PHP, and many other open-source languages have a **HUGE** community of developers that use, play with, and help to build the language and it's extensions.

And frameworks make it incredibly easy to use a lot (or just a few) of these extensions. We call this working with a 'stack' of processing tools. For example, in my personal development work, I use SASS as a CSS pre-processor, and `git` for 'version' management. (I haven't got so far as to have discrete versions, but git is still a useful backup tool). Ruby on Rails implements both of these, and many other build tools such as grunt or require.js, to manage javascript file processing.
