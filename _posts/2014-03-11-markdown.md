"Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. [It] allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid [HTML]."

It looks like this:

        Sample Markdown Cheat Sheet
        =========================== 

        This is a sample markdown file to help you write Markdown quickly :)

        If you use the fabulous [Sublime Text 2 editor][ST2] along with the [Markdown Preview plugin][MarkdownPreview], open your ST2 Palette with `CMD+P` then choose `Markdown Preview in browser` to see the result in your browser.

        ## Text basics
        this is *italic* and this is **bold** .  another _italic_ and another __bold__

        this is `important` text. and percentage signs : % and `%`

        This is a paragraph with a footnote (builtin parser only). [^note-id] 

        Insert `[ toc ]` without spaces to generate a table of contents (builtin parser only).

        ## Indentation
        > Here is some indented text
        >> even more indented

        ## Titles
        # Big title (h1)
        ## Middle title (h2)
        ### Smaller title (h3)
        #### and so on (hX)
        ##### and so on (hX)
        ###### and so on (hX)

        ## Example lists (1)

         - bullets can be `-`, `+`, or `*`
         - bullet list 1
         - bullet list 2
            - sub item 1
            - sub item 2

                with indented text inside

         - bullet list 3
         + bullet list 4
         * bullet list 5

        ## Links

        This is an [example inline link](http://lmgtfy.com/) and [another one with a title](http://lmgtfy.com/ "Hello, world").

        Links can also be reference based : [reference 1][ref1] or [reference 2 with title][ref2].

        References are usually placed at the bottom of the document

        ## Images

        A sample image :

        ![revolunet logo](http://www.revolunet.com/static/parisjs8/img/logo-revolunet-carre.jpg "revolunet logo")

        As links, images can also use references instead of inline links :

        ![revolunet logo][revolunet-logo]


        ## Code

        It's quite easy to show code in markdown files.

        Backticks can be used to `highlight` some words.

        Also, any indented block is considered a code block.  If `enable_highlight` is `true`, syntax highlighting will be included (for the builtin parser - the github parser does this automatically).

            <script>
                //document.location = 'http://lmgtfy.com/?q=markdown+cheat+sheet';
            </script>

        ## Math

        When `enable_mathjax` is `true`, inline math can be included \\(\frac{\pi}{2}\\) $\pi$

        Alternatively, math can be written on its own line:

        $$F(\omega) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) \, e^{ - i \omega t}dt$$

        \\[\int_0^1 f(t) \mathrm{d}t\\]

        \\[\sum_j \gamma_j^2/d_j\\]
