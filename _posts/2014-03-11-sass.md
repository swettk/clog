## (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) <a name="sass"></a>
SASS is a CSS Pre-processor. Which means that it generates CSS. SASS extends standard CSS in a number of ways, but primary among them are the use of variables and functions. A variable allows us to define a value in a short-hand, that can be re-used throughout our code. For example:

    $titleRed = rgb(212,12,12);

This now allows us to use the `$titleRed` variable throughout our code, without having to remember the specific rgb values. It also allows us to change the value of $titleRed, and have all instances where we've used the variable update automatically.

SASS also allows us to abstract some of our mathematical calculations.

    #container {
        width: ($bodyWidth - 20) / 2;
    }
